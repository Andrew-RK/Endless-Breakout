# Endless Breakout
Breakout game made in python with pygame. My first game project.

How to play:
Endless Breakout is like regular Breakout, but with a few simple twists.
Instead of destroying bricks, the objective of the game is to survive as long as possible.
The longer you survive, the more points youâ€™ll score. New balls spawn every 10 seconds.
Let any ball go out of bounds and it is game over. Using the mouse, your paddle is able to move
anywhere on the screen, not just the bottom. In addition, your paddle comes equipped with two
special abilities: Left click increases your score faster, but also increases the speed of
the balls. Right click slows the balls down, but also consumes energy. Use your abilities wisely!


Planned future updates:

 -Physics rework
 
 -Better graphics
 
 -Sound and music
 -Menus
 -Customizable controls
 -Save highscore between play sessions
 -Gameplay tweaks and balances


Changelog:

3/15/2016:

Version 0.2.1:
-First public release
-Added some randomness to the ball spawns

3/14/2016:

Version 0.2:
-New game mechanics:
  Left click scores you double the points, but also speeds balls up
  Right click slows balls down, but also consumes energy
  Energy is displayed on the statsSurface
-Game window is now widescreen.
-Rewrote text drawing code to consume fewer system resources
-Time is now displayed in m:s.ms format
-New DEBUGMODE command:
  'x': Spawns 100 balls.
-Misc small fixes

3/12/2016:

Version 0.1:
-Game window now consists of two surfaces: playfield and statsSurface
-statsSurface shows the following stats:
  highscore
  score
  number of balls in play
  time survived
-Improved DEBUGMODE. When DEBUGMODE is on, it enables the following
 commands:
  'g': Enables godMode. Prevents balls from going out of bounds and freezes
  score value at 0.
  'b': Spawns a new ball.
 DEBUGMODE also displays the following variables on the statsSurface:
  FPS
  current frame
  godMode
  mouse position
-Improved game over screen.
-Mouse can no longer leave the game window while the game loop is running

Version 0.02:
-Added DEBUGMODE.
-Paddle can now move anywhere on the screen.

3/11/2016:

Version 0.01:
-First stable build. New balls spawn every 10 seconds. Game ends when a ball
 goes out of bounds.


Gameplay observations:
-I'm usually unable to see my energy meter while playing, because my eyes are on the playfield. I'm going to draw an energy bar onto the paddle to see if that helps. Another game called Alphabounce actually does this for certain power-ups.
-A freshly spawned ball can sometimes catch me off guard when it first starts moving. I'll try making freshly spawned balls gradually accelerate, instead of instantly going from stationary to full speed in one frame.
-Plan to try adding visual feedback for abilities, to make them more satisfying to use.
-The difficulty does not just depend on the number of balls and their speed, but also the composition of the balls. A set of balls moving in a predictable pattern is much easier to juggle. I'll try playing around with this, eg: Having the balls randomly change direction every once in awhile, which will be telegraphed in advance.
